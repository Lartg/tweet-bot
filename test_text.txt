He was just a servant, and Shin were easy to ignore. Most out here in the East thought
Szeth’s kind were docile and harmless. They were generally right.
The drummers began a new rhythm. The beats shook Szeth like a quartet of thumping
hearts, pumping waves of invisible blood through the room. Szeth’s masters—who were
dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdoms—sat at their own tables. They
were men with skin of black marbled with red. Parshendi, they were named—cousins to the
more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world. An oddity. They did
not call themselves Parshendi; this was the Alethi name for them. It meant, roughly,
“parshmen who can think.” Neither side seemed to see that as an insult.
The Parshendi had brought the musicians. At first, the Alethi lighteyes had been
hesitant. To them, drums were base instruments of the common, darkeyed people. But wine
was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety, and now the Alethi elite danced with
abandon.
